          <h1>The Brahmā Net<br />
            Brahmajāla Sutta&#160;&#160;(DN&#160;1)</h1>
          <h2 class="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>This sutta—the first of the entire Sutta Piṭaka—introduces the Buddha as a practitioner and as a teacher. Because its portrait focuses on the Dhamma qualities that he exemplifies, it acts as an introduction to the Dhamma he teaches as well.</em></p>
<p><em>The portrait falls into four sections, each presenting an aspect of the Buddha’s accomplishments:</em></p>
<div class="iblock">
<p><em>his attitude toward praise and criticism,</em></p>
<p><em>his virtue,</em></p>
<p><em>his discernment,</em></p>
<p><em>his release.</em></p>
</div>
<p><em><strong>Praise &amp; criticism.</strong> In the first section of the sutta, the Buddha meets with the monks after a day and night in which he and the monks have had to listen to two wanderers of other sects arguing as to whether the Buddha should be criticized or praised. He counsels the monks not to let their minds be affected by such discussions, his reasoning being that only if the mind is unaffected can it see clearly what is true or false in the words of criticism or praise—and only then can it respond appropriately. He goes on to say that once the monks have clearly evaluated what is said, they can explain what is false in the criticism and true in the praise. Of course, the converse is also possible—that the criticism could be true or the praise false—and there are other passages in the Canon, such as <a href="/suttas/KN/Dhp/Ch06.html#dhp076">Dhp 76–77</a>, that underline the importance of appreciating and benefitting from criticism when it points out genuine faults. But here, given that the remainder of the sutta is devoted to praise of the Buddha, the emphasis is on the truth of the praise. The main question, both in this section and in the remainder of the sutta, is what sort of praise does the Buddha justice.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s also worth noting that here, as in the rest of the Sutta Piṭaka, the Buddha doesn’t respond to praise with a show of false modesty (see, for instance, <a href="/suttas/MN/MN36.html">MN 36</a> and <a href="/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp3_7.html">Sn 3:7</a>). The proper response to praise is either to remain silent or, when it would be helpful as a teaching strategy, to note where the praise is true.</em></p>
<p class="first"><em><strong>Virtue.</strong> The many virtues attributed to the Buddha in the second section of the sutta are attributed in other suttas in the Dīgha Nikāya to the ideal members of his monastic Saṅgha as well. Although the list is long, it comes nowhere near to covering all the rules that the Buddha formulated for his monks. Instead, it focuses on the rules that would be most apparent to Buddhist lay followers and to followers of other religions. In the Vinaya, the section of the Canon dealing with monastic rules, the Buddha’s reasons for formulating the rules fall into three main categories: to inspire faith in others, to help the monks and nuns cleanse their minds of defilement, and to foster harmony within the monastic communities. In the context of this sutta, the list of virtues seems focused primarily on rules falling into the first category, but the discussions of the same list in other suttas of the Dīgha Nikāya show that they fall into the second category as well.</em></p>
<p><em>A special feature of the list is the amount of space it devotes to types of wrong livelihood that the Buddha and his monks avoid. The detailed listing given here is much more extensive than even the Vinaya’s discussion of the topic.</em></p>
<p class="first"><em><strong>Discernment.</strong> The longest section of the sutta is devoted to the Buddha’s analysis of 62 views and his reasons for rejecting them. Rather than saying that all views lead to the same goal, the Buddha makes clear that although all views inspire action, the actions they inspire lead to many different destinations. This point is so important that the compilers of the Dīgha Nikāya not only chose this sutta to open the collection, but also followed it with another sutta focused on the same theme. The compilers of the Majjhima Nikāya also opened their collection with two suttas that clearly point out what the teaching is not, at the same time using their explanation of why it’s not that, to demonstrate what it is. This teaching strategy is in line with the Buddha’s statement in <a href="/suttas/MN/MN117.html">MN 117</a>, that the role of right view begins by distinguishing right view from wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>The 62 views that the Buddha analyzes fall loosely into two main groups: theories of the past and theories of the future. I say “loosely” because some of the theories, even though they are listed in one of these two groups, don’t clearly fall into either. Theories of the past that clearly belong to the first group deal with the question of whether the soul and cosmos are eternal, partially eternal, or arose fortuitously out of nothing. However, this group also includes theories addressing the question of whether the cosmos is finite or infinite, along with a series of agnostic positions—called “eel-wriggling”—where their proponents, through fear or stupidity, refuse to take a position on any issue. Theories of the future that clearly belong to the second group deal with the question of whether the self survives death and, if so, what shape it takes in its survival. However, this group also includes theories of how the self attains unbinding (nibbāna) in the here-and-now.</em></p>
<p><em>Taken on their own, these theories clear up four important misunderstandings about early Buddhism and the context in which it was taught. To begin with, the existence of theories denying past lifetimes on the one hand (<a href="#dn1sec17">17</a>–<a href="#dn1sec18">18</a>) and future lives on the other (<a href="#dn1sec51">51–57</a>) disproves the common misunderstanding that everyone in the Buddha’s time believed in rebirth, and that the Buddha adopted the idea of rebirth by unthinkingly picking it up from this culture. The fact that the topic was debated showed that the possibility of no rebirth was in the air, and that the Buddha’s choice to teach rebirth was conscious and deliberate.</em></p>
<p><em>Second, the term “unbinding” in these theories is defined as the peace found in the pleasures of the senses and the four jhānas (states of mental absorption). So, obviously, it carries no connotations of extinction. This lends support to the point that the Buddha’s use of the word unbinding for his goal also did not mean extinction, a point further supported by the fact that he refused to define the arahant after death as existing, not existing, both, or neither. Because, in the Buddha’s perspective, beings are defined by their attachments (<a href="/suttas/SN/SN23_2.html">SN 23:2</a>), and because arahants have no attachments, there is no way that they can be defined or described in any way at all.</em></p>
<p><em>Third, the way “self”</em> (attā) <em>is defined in the annihilationist views (<a href="#dn1sec51">51–57</a>) shows that the concept of self in the Buddha’s time did not—contrary to what is often believed—always have to mean an eternally existing self. In each of these views, the self is defined in such a way that it will be annihilated at death.</em></p>
<p><em>Fourth, 20 of the views (<a href="#dn1sec1">1–3</a>, <a href="#dn1sec5">5–7</a>, <a href="#dn1sec9">9–11</a>, <a href="#dn1sec17">17</a>, <a href="#dn1sec52">52–57</a>, and <a href="#dn1sec59">59–62</a>) are based on meditative experiences: jhāna, the formless states, and knowledge of previous lives that can be gained based on jhāna. This fact corrects two misunderstandings: one, that the practice of jhāna began with the Buddha; and two, that any insight coming from a concentrated mind can be trusted to be true. If the Buddha were the first to have discovered jhāna, none of these cases would have occurred in time for the Buddha to refute them. If all insights coming from concentration were reliable, no one would misinterpret what their meditative experiences meant.</em></p>
<p><em>A feature common to almost all of the 62 theories is that they are phrased in terms of self and cosmos—in other words, in the same terms as what the Buddha describes as “becoming”</em> (bhava): <em>the act of taking on an identity in a particular world of experience (see</em> <a href="/books/ParadoxOfBecoming/Section0001.html">The Paradox of Becoming</a>).</em> <em>Because the craving that leads to further becoming is the cause of suffering and stress, the Buddha does not attempt to refute these theories by taking a different position framed in the same terms. Instead, he approaches and rejects these theories from another framework entirely: that of kamma and dependent co-arising</em> (paṭicca samuppāda).</p>
<p><em>Within this framework, the question becomes not “Can these views be reasonably defended?” It becomes, “Is it skillful kamma to hold to these views?” This falls in line with Vajjiya Māhita’s statement in <a href="/suttas/AN/AN10_94.html">AN 10:94</a> where, in defending the Buddha against some wanderers who accuse the Buddha of being a nihilist who doesn’t teach anything, he says “I tell you, venerable sirs, that the Blessed One righteously declares that ‘This is skillful.’ He declares that ‘This is unskillful.’ Declaring that ‘This is skillful’ and ‘This is unskillful,’ he is one who has declared (a teaching). He is not a nihilist, one who doesn’t declare anything.” At the end of that sutta, the Buddha affirms that Vajjiya has defended him well. But of course, the teaching doesn’t end there. In <a href="/suttas/AN/AN2_19.html">AN 2:19</a> the Buddha exhorts the monks to abandon what is unskillful and to develop what is skillful. So the question comes down to: Should these views, as a type of mental kamma, be abandoned or developed?</em></p>
<p><em>This is why the Buddha’s analysis of views here in DN 1 focuses less on the</em> content <em>of the views and more on the</em> kamma <em>of holding to them: the actions that lead to them, and the kammic destination that holding them can lead to. The verdict in all 62 cases is that the views should be abandoned. The Buddha’s analysis of the kamma of these views in this section of the sutta is an example, then, of right view in action: how to use the teachings on kamma and dependent co-arising to let go of actions leading to suffering. Taken together with the following section, on the Buddha’s release, this section provides a clear contrast to the 62 views by showing the excellent kammic consequences of adopting the Buddha’s general approach to views as a form of kamma.</em></p>
<p><em>His approach is obviously inspired by the three knowledges he gained on the night of his awakening:</em></p>
<div class="iblock">
<p><em>(a) knowledge of previous lives;</em></p>
<p><em>(b) knowledge of the death and rebirth of beings based on their actions (kamma), which in turn are based on their views; and</em></p>
<p><em>(c) release from rebirth that comes from adopting right view, i.e., viewing action in terms of the four noble truths.</em></p>
</div>
<p><em>a. From the first knowledge: As the Buddha points out, views are based on previous actions and experiences, and in many instances—cited explicitly in the section on views dealing with the past, and implicitly in the views on annihilation and nibbāna here-and-now—these actions and experiences can be traced to previous lives and/or to a misinterpretation of experiences gained through meditation. (See <a href="/suttas/MN/MN136.html">MN 136</a> on other misunderstandings that can come from misinterpreting past-life memories gained in concentration.)</em></p>
<p class="first"><em>b. From the second knowledge: The act of holding to a view is an act of clinging (“agitation &amp; vacillation” in the words of the sutta) that will inspire actions leading to a particular realm in the round of rebirth. It’s worth noting that although the Buddha goes into great detail on the actions giving rise to some of the 62 views, he gives only a brief, general reference to his knowledge of the destination to which all the views lead. However, the importance of this latter knowledge is emphasized by the fact that it forms a refrain repeated again and again throughout this section of the sutta. The main point of the refrain is that right view, as it overcomes clinging even to itself, leads to a destination that surpasses the destinations to which the 62 views lead.</em></p>
<p class="first"><em>c. From the third knowledge: Views can be overcome by noting that the act of clinging is based on craving, craving is based on feeling, and feeling is based on contact at the six sense media. This sequence of conditions is drawn from the Buddha’s teaching on dependent co-arising, which is an elaborated version of the four noble truths. By replacing ignorance of this sequence with knowledge—knowing the origination, passing away, allure, drawbacks of, and escape from feelings and sensory contact—one gains release from all clingings, even to the results of this knowledge, and from all destinations in the realm of becoming.</em></p>
<p class="first"><em>Other suttas—such as <a href="/suttas/MN/MN102.html">MN 102</a> and <a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_81.html">SN 22:81</a>—take a similar approach to views, focusing on the way in which knowledge of the way in which views are fabricated and clung to can lead the mind to stop clinging to views altogether. Two suttas, however, are especially helpful in expanding on the approach taken here in DN 1: <a href="/suttas/SN/SN41_3.html">SN 41:3</a> and <a href="/suttas/AN/AN10_93.html">AN 10:93</a>.</em></p>
<p><em><a href="/suttas/SN/SN41_3.html">SN 41:3</a>, in a direct reference to DN 1, notes that the 62 views listed here, as well as other views, all come from self-identity views, which define the self around any of the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, fabrications, and consciousness: either identical with the aggregate, possessing the aggregate, in the aggregate, or containing the aggregate. The connection between self-identity views and the 62 views in this sutta can be clearly seen in the topics of the views listed here: Once you assume a self, you get caught up in questions of what it is, the dimensions of the world in which it can find its nourishment, its past, its future after death, and what constitutes its happiness here and now. Even the four cases of “eel-wriggling,” or agnosticism listed here can be understood as motivated by the desire to protect the self from the harassment that comes from expounding a view to others.</em></p>
<p><em>The antidote to this kind of thinking is not to assume that there is no self—<a href="/suttas/MN/MN2.html">MN 2</a> counsels against trying to give any answer to such questions as “What am I?” and “Do I exist? Do I not exist?” (see the articles, <a href="/books/Noble&True/Section0010.html">“The Not-self Strategy”</a> and <a href="/books/uncollected/NotSelfRevisited.html">“The Limits of Description”</a> on this point). Instead, <a href="/suttas/SN/SN41_3.html">SN 41:3</a> recommends a more subtle strategy: learning from people of integrity how not to assume a self in any way around the five aggregates. But it does not explain how this is done. <a href="/suttas/SN/SN12_15.html">SN 12:15</a> advises contemplating the origination and passing away of events in the world of the six senses until even the notions of “existence” and “non-existence” don’t occur to the mind. At that point, all that seems to arise and pass away is stress, a realization that allows the mind to let go of all fabrications. This is its definition of right view.</em></p>
<p><em>The most important aspect of right view, as noted above, is that it reaches a point where it undercuts clinging even to itself and to the release that comes when that level of clinging is abandoned. DN 1 itself doesn’t explain how, but <a href="/suttas/AN/AN10_93.html">AN 10:93</a> gives a clue. After seeing that all other views, because they are fabricated, are stressful, and that because they are stressful, they don’t deserve to be claimed as “me” or “mine,” right view then applies the same analysis to itself as a fabricated phenomenon. That’s how it finds the full escape that comes from dispassion for every fabrication, even the fabrication of the path.</em></p>
<p class="first"><em>The fact that clinging to views is overcome through knowledge, and not through the simple decision not to formulate views, is worth emphasizing again and again. As <a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_81.html">SN 22:81</a> points out, such an agnostic decision is a fabrication based on ignorance, and so it cannot escape from suffering and stress.</em></p>
<p><em>The same point applies to the “eel-wrigglers” mentioned in DN 1. Interestingly enough, one of the issues that eel-wrigglers waffle on is precisely an issue on which the Buddha himself refuses to take a position: the status of an arahant after death. The difference is that the eel-wrigglers’ refusal is because of their stupidity and fear; the Buddha’s refusal, however, is because of his knowledge that any attempt to answer the question is unskillful kamma not conducive to the end of suffering. What this means, of course, is that refusing to take a position on an issue is not always a case of eel-wriggling, as has sometimes been claimed. It’s eel-wriggling only when done out of ignorance, stupidity, or fear.</em></p>
<p class="first"><em><strong>Release.</strong> In the final section of the sutta, the Buddha states the reward of developing discernment into the kamma of views: The Tathāgata—a term for the Buddha and, in some suttas, for his arahant disciples—will never be reborn. Freed from all clinging, he is totally released from suffering and stress.</em></p>
<p class="first"><em><strong>Connections.</strong> DN 1 connects these four aspect of the Buddha’s behavior—his attitude toward praise and criticism, his virtue, his discernment, and his release—by saying that ordinary people, when praising the Buddha, focus on nothing more than his virtue; only someone of acute discernment can praise him in a way that does justice to his discernment and—through that—to his release.</em></p>
<p class="first"><em>Other suttas in the Piṭaka, however, show that, in practice, the connections among these four aspects go much deeper than that.</em></p>
<p><em>For instance, there is a direct relationship between the Buddha’s discernment and his attitude toward criticism and praise. As <a href="/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp4_8.html">Sn 4:8</a> points out, India in the Buddha’s time had a tradition where proponents of different philosophies would engage in public debates. The sutta further says, though, that the actual purpose of such debates wasn’t to arrive at the truth. It was to gain praise. This was why the Buddha counseled his students not to engage in such debates. However, as DN 1 shows, the true purpose of developing knowledge about the kamma of views isn’t to gain praise from the public. It’s to gain release from suffering and stress. Similarly, the purpose of discussion—and this applies to the type of debates that the Buddha</em> would <em>engage in—is to lead to the liberation of the mind (<a href="/suttas/AN/AN3_68.html">AN 3:68</a>).</em></p>
<p><em>There is also a direct relationship between the Buddha’s attitude toward praise and criticism on the one hand, and his release on the other. Praise and criticism are “worldly conditions” (<a href="/suttas/AN/AN8_6.html">AN 8:6–8</a>). As <a href="/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp2_4.html">Sn 2:4</a> states, one of the fruits of arahantship is that the mind, when touched by worldly conditions, isn’t shaken.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, there is the relationship between the Buddha’s virtue and his discernment. As DN 4 points out, virtue purifies discernment, and discernment purifies virtue, in the same way that the right hand washes the left hand, and the left hand washes the right. This relationship, too, is echoed in the Buddha’s standards for debate: A person was worthy of talking to, he said, only if that person conducted the discussion in a fair, truthful, and ethical way  (<a href="/suttas/AN/AN3_68.html">AN 3:68</a>).</em></p>
<p><em>The connections among the four aspects of the Buddha’s accomplishments mentioned here are only a few of the many possible ones that could be cited from the other suttas in the Piṭaka. However, they are enough to show that the Brahmajāla, though long, is only an introduction to the virtues of the Buddha and the riches of the Dhamma he taught. In particular, it has to be augmented by the following sutta, <a href="/suttas/DN/DN02.html">DN 2</a>, to give a sense of the Buddha’s skill in the practice of concentration. Still, because the Brahmajāla raises such important issues, helping to make clear what kind of teacher the Buddha was and was not, what the Dhamma is and what it is not—along with the fact that the final release attained and taught by the Buddha lies beyond all this—it’s easy to see why it was such a strong candidate to be placed first in the Sutta Piṭaka as a gateway to the entire collection.</em></p>

          <h2>[ I ]</h2>
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was traveling on the highway between Rājagaha &amp; Nālanda with a large Saṅgha of monks, approximately 500 monks.</p>
<p>And Suppiya the wanderer was traveling on the highway between Rājagaha &amp; Nālanda with his apprentice, Brahmadatta the young brahman.</p>
<p>Along the way, Suppiya the wanderer spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, in dispraise of the Dhamma, in dispraise of the Saṅgha. But Suppiya the wanderer’s apprentice, Brahmadatta the young brahman, spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, in praise of the Dhamma, in praise of the Saṅgha. Thus both of these, mentor &amp; apprentice, speaking in direct contradiction to each other, followed right behind the Blessed One and the Saṅgha of monks.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, together with the Saṅgha of monks, entered the royal resthouse at Mango Stone to spend the night. And Suppiya the wanderer, together with his apprentice, Brahmadatta the young brahman, entered the royal resthouse at Mango Stone to spend the night. There, too, Suppiya the wanderer spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, in dispraise of the Dhamma, in dispraise of the Saṅgha. But Suppiya the wanderer’s apprentice, Brahmadatta the young brahman, spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, in praise of the Dhamma, in praise of the Saṅgha. Thus both of these, mentor &amp; apprentice, speaking in direct contradiction to each other, followed right behind the Blessed One and the Saṅgha of monks.</p>
<p>Then, among a large number of monks who had arisen in the last watch of the night and were sitting gathered together in a pavilion, this discussion arose: “Isn’t it amazing! Isn’t it astounding!—how the Blessed One, the one who knows, the one who sees, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, has truly experienced the differing convictions of beings. For this Suppiya the wanderer speaks in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, in dispraise of the Dhamma, in dispraise of the Saṅgha. But Suppiya the wanderer’s apprentice, Brahmadatta the young brahman, speaks in many ways in praise of the Buddha, in praise of the Dhamma, in praise of the Saṅgha. Thus both of these, mentor &amp; apprentice, speaking in direct contradiction to each other, follow right behind the Blessed One and the Saṅgha of monks.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, knowing this discussion of the monks, went to the pavilion and, on arrival, sat down on a seat laid out. Seated, he addressed the monks: “For what topic of conversation are you sitting gathered together here? What is the topic of your conversation that has been interrupted midway?”</p>
<p>When this was said, the monks said to the Blessed One, “Just now, lord, among us—as we had arisen in the last watch of the night and were sitting gathered together in (this) pavilion—this discussion arose: ‘Isn’t it amazing! Isn’t it astounding!—how the Blessed One, the one who knows, the one who sees, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, has truly experienced the differing convictions of beings. For this Suppiya the wanderer speaks in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, in dispraise of the Dhamma, in dispraise of the Saṅgha. But Suppiya the wanderer’s apprentice, Brahmadatta the young brahman, speaks in many ways in praise of the Buddha, in praise of the Dhamma, in praise of the Saṅgha. Thus both of these, mentor &amp; apprentice, speaking in direct contradiction to each other, follow right behind the Blessed One and the Saṅgha of monks.’ This was the topic of our conversation that was interrupted midway when the Blessed One arrived.”</p>
<p>“Monks, if others were to speak in dispraise of me, in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Saṅgha, neither hatred nor antagonism nor displeasure of mind would be proper. If others were to speak in dispraise of me, in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Saṅgha, and at that you would be upset and angered, that would be an obstruction for you yourselves. If others were to speak in dispraise of me, in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Saṅgha, and at that you would be upset and angered, would you know what of those others was well-said or poorly said?”</p>
<p>“No, lord.”</p>
<p>“If others were to speak in dispraise of me, in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Saṅgha, you should unravel and explicate what is unfactual as unfactual: ‘This is unfactual, this is inaccurate, there is nothing of that in us, and that is not to be found in us.’</p>
<p>“If others were to speak in praise of me, in praise of the Dhamma, or in praise of the Saṅgha, neither joy nor gladness nor exhilaration of mind would be proper. If others were to speak in praise of me, in praise of the Dhamma, or in praise of the Saṅgha, and at that you would be joyful, glad, &amp; exhilarated, that would be an obstruction for you yourselves. If others were to speak in praise of me, in praise of the Dhamma, or in praise of the Saṅgha, and at that you would be joyful, glad, &amp; exhilarated, would you know what of those others was well-said or poorly said?”</p>

<p>“If others were to speak in praise of me, in praise of the Dhamma, or in praise of the Saṅgha, you should unravel and explicate what is factual as factual: ‘This is factual, this is accurate, there is that in us, and that is to be found in us.’</p>

<p id="dn1sec5">5. “There ultimately comes a time when, with the passing of a long stretch of time, this cosmos devolves. When the cosmos is devolving, beings for the most part head toward the Radiant (brahmās). There they stay: mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, coursing through the air, established in beauty for a long stretch of time. Then there ultimately comes a time when, with the passing of a long stretch of time, this cosmos evolves. When the cosmos is evolving, an empty Brahmā palace appears. Then a certain being—from the exhaustion of his life span or the exhaustion of his merit<span class="fn"><a href="#dn1note08">8</a></span><!--end fn cite-->—falls from the company of the Radiant and re-arises in the empty Brahmā palace. And there he still stays mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, coursing through the air, established in beauty for a long stretch of time.</p>
<p>“After dwelling there alone for a long time, he experiences displeasure &amp; agitation: ‘O, if only other beings would come to this world!’</p>
<p>“Then other beings, through the ending of their life span or the ending of their merit, fall from the company of the Radiant and reappear in the Brahmā palace, in the company of that being. And there they still stay mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, coursing through the air, established in beauty for a long stretch of time.</p>
<p>“Then the thought occurs to the being who reappeared first: ‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer &amp; Ruler, Father of All That Have Been &amp; Shall Be.<span class="fn"><a href="#dn1note09">9</a></span><!--end fn cite--> These beings were created by me. Why is that? First the thought occurred to me, “O, if only other beings would come to this world!” And thus my direction of will brought these beings to this world.’ As for the beings who reappeared later, this thought occurs to them: ‘This is Brahmā… Father of All That Have Been &amp; Shall Be. We were created by this Brahmā. Why is that? We saw that he appeared here before, while we appeared after.’ The being who reappeared first is of longer life span, more beautiful, &amp; more influential, while the beings who reappeared later are of shorter life span, less beautiful, &amp; less influential.</p>
<p>“Now, there is the possibility, monks, that a certain being, having fallen from that company, comes to this world. Having come to this world, he goes forth from the home life into homelessness. Having gone forth from the home life into homelessness, he—through ardency, through exertion, through commitment, through heedfulness, through right attention—touches an awareness-concentration such that in his concentrated mind he recollects that former life, but nothing prior to that. He says, ‘We were created by Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. He is constant, permanent, eternal, not subject to change, and will remain just like that for eternity.

When emerging, they emerge trapped here. When emerging, they emerge encompassed here under this net. Just as if a deft fisherman or fisherman’s apprentice were to cover a small body of water with a fine-meshed net: The thought would occur to him, ‘Any sizeable creatures in this body of water all come under this net. When emerging, they emerge trapped here. When emerging, they emerge encompassed here under this net.’ In this same way, monks, any contemplatives &amp; brahmans who are theorists about the past, theorists about the future, &amp; theorists about the past &amp; the future, who hold views about the past &amp; the future, who approve of various beliefs with reference to the past &amp; the future, all come under this net with its 62 interstices.

<p>“The body of the Tathāgata stands with the cord binding it to becoming cut through. As long as his body remains, human beings &amp; devas will see him. But with the break-up of the body and the depletion of life, human beings &amp; devas will see him no more. Just as with the cutting of the stalk of a bunch of mangoes, all the mangoes connected to the stalk follow with it; in the same way, the body of the Tathāgata stands with the cord binding it to becoming<span class="fn"><a href="#dn1note34">34</a></span><!--end fn cite--> cut through.

            <p class="notetitle">Notes</p><!--end notetitle-->
            <p id="dn1note01">1. In many suttas—such as <a href="/suttas/DN/DN09.html">DN 9</a>, <a href="/suttas/MN/MN63.html">MN 63</a>, <a href="/suttas/MN/MN72.html">MN 72</a>, and <a href="/suttas/SN/SN44_7.html">SN 44:7–8</a>—the Buddha and his disciples refuse to take a stand on whether the cosmos is eternal or not. See <a href="/books/SkillInQuestions/Section0013.html"><em>Skill in Questions,</em> Chapter 8</a>, for a discussion of the reasons for their refusal. As a general principle, the Buddha warns against speculation about the cosmos, saying in <a href="/suttas/AN/AN4_77.html">AN 4:77</a> that it’s one of four types of conjecture that can lead to madness. What he <em>does</em> say about how long there has been a cosmos (see, for instance, <a href="/suttas/SN/SN15_3.html">SN 15:3</a>) is that transmigration comes from an inconceivable beginning. As for the length of time the cosmos will last, in <a href="/suttas/SN/SN12_44.html">SN 12:44</a> he teaches the path to the end of the cosmos—which he equates with the end of suffering—but it’s an end for each person to find individually. In <a href="/suttas/AN/AN10_95.html">AN 10:95</a> he refuses to answer the question of whether all or a half or a third of the cosmos will follow that path to release.</p>
<p>As for the self, however, the Buddha regards the view that the self is eternal as a particularly evil form of wrong view. The form this view takes in <a href="/suttas/DN/DN02.html">DN 2</a> shows that it denies the power, and even the reality, of action.</p>
<p id="dn1note02">2. The phrase, “purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement” is not in the Sinhalese edition of the Canon.</p>
<p id="dn1note03">3. Compare the number of lifetimes remembered here and in the following cases with the number of lifetimes the Buddha remembered on the night of his awakening: “many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many eons of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion” (<a href="/suttas/MN/MN4.html">MN 4</a>).</p>
<p id="dn1note04">4. Notice that the Buddha doesn’t try to judge whether theorists of this sort make proper or improper use of their logic. In both <a href="/suttas/AN/AN3_66.html">AN 3:66</a> and <a href="/suttas/MN/MN95.html">MN 95</a> he states that just because a view is logical doesn’t mean that it’s skillful or true.</p>
<p id="dn1note05">5. This sentence, repeated throughout this sutta, is hard to square with the fact that the Canon itself contains forms of these views that are not listed in this sutta. In the present case, for instance, <a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_81.html">SN 22:81</a> lists the following view, not found here, as a form of eternalism: “This self is the same as the cosmos. This I will be after death, constant, lasting, eternal, not subject to change.” <a href="/suttas/MN/MN102.html">MN 102</a>, for its part, lists views of the self after death not listed in the relevant part of this sutta. It seems more pertinent to the thrust of the sutta to say that, whatever form a view may take on the topics listed here, it has to come under observation given in the refrains that trace all views to feelings and sensory contact. That is the true “net” of the sutta.</p>
<p id="dn1note06">6. It is instructive to compare this refrain, which follows each subset of the 62 views, with similar refrains in other suttas that treat views from the same perspective. For instance:</p>
<p>From <a href="/suttas/MN/MN102.html">MN 102</a>: “‘With regard to that—fabricated, gross—there is still the cessation of fabrications: There <em>is</em> this.’ Knowing that, seeing the escape from it, the Tathāgata has gone beyond it.”</p>
<p>From <a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_81.html">SN 22:81</a>: “That assumption is a fabrication. Now what is the cause, what is the origination, what is the birth, what is the coming-into-existence of that fabrication? To an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person, touched by that which is felt born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That fabrication is born of that. And that fabrication is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen. That craving… That feeling… That contact… That ignorance is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen. It is by knowing &amp; seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to effluents.”</p>
<p>From <a href="/suttas/AN/AN10_93.html">AN 10:93</a>: [Anāthapiṇḍika is speaking:] “Venerable sirs, whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen: That is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. Whatever is stress is not me, is not what I am, is not my self. Having seen this well with right discernment as it has come to be, I also discern the higher escape from it as it has come to be.”</p>
<p>On the Buddha’s overall attitude toward the truth of views, see the article, “<a href="/books/Noble&True/Section0006.html">Truths with Consequences</a>.”</p>
<p id="dn1note07">7. As the following discussion shows, various forms of theism would come under this category.</p>
<p id="dn1note08">8. There is an implied criticism of Brahmanism in this sentence: The Great Brahmā, the highest god in their pantheon, has gained his position not because of his greatness but because the merit that would have allowed him to stay in a higher realm was exhausted. See <a href="/suttas/MN/MN49.html">MN 49</a>.</p>
<p id="dn1note09">9. See the story of the Great Brahmā in <a href="/suttas/DN/DN11.html">DN 11</a>.</p>
<p id="dn1note10">10. These devas are listed in <a href="/suttas/DN/DN20.html">DN 20</a>.</p>
<p id="dn1note11">11. These devas, too, are listed in <a href="/suttas/DN/DN20.html">DN 20</a>. The Commentary to this passage states that they stare at one another out of envy and anger, but it could also be the case that they stare out of lust.</p>
<p id="dn1note12">12. This is the view propounded by Sāti the Fisherman’s Son in <a href="/suttas/MN/MN38.html">MN 38</a>—a view that the Buddha characterizes as evil, probably because it denies the role of kamma in shaping experience. However, see <a href="/suttas/MN/MN38.html#mn38note01">notes 1</a> and <a href="/suttas/MN/MN38.html#mn38note02">2</a> to that sutta.</p>
<p id="dn1note13">13. The Buddha consistently refuses to take a stance on the question of whether the cosmos is finite or infinite (see, for example, <a href="/suttas/MN/MN63.html">MN 63</a>). In <a href="/suttas/AN/AN4_45.html">AN 4:45</a> he limits himself to saying that it isn’t possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one doesn’t take birth, age, die, pass away, or reappear, but that the cosmos, its origination, its cessation, and the path to its cessation can be found in this fathom-long body. For his definitions of the word, “cosmos,” see <a href="/suttas/SN/SN35_82.html">SN 35:82</a> and <a href="/suttas/AN/AN10_95.html">AN 10:95</a>.</p>
<p id="dn1note14">14. In <a href="/suttas/MN/MN36.html">MN 36</a>, the Buddha characterizes his search for awakening as a search for what is skillful. And in <a href="/suttas/AN/AN3_62.html">AN 3:62</a> he identifies one of the main responsibilities of a teaching is that it give grounds for deciding what is skillful and what’s not.</p>
<p id="dn1note15">15. One of the basic tenets of mundane right view is that there is a world after death. See <a href="/suttas/MN/MN117.html">MN 117</a> and the discussion of the levels of right view in <a href="/books/OnThePath/Section0008.html"><em>On the Path,</em> Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p id="dn1note16">16. The existence of beings that wander on is one of the tenets of the second knowledge in the Buddha’s awakening (see <a href="/suttas/MN/MN19.html">MN 19</a>). <a href="/suttas/SN/SN23_2.html">SN 23:2</a> defines a being in terms of its attachments; <a href="/suttas/SN/SN44_9.html">SN 44:9</a> describes how a being takes rebirth through craving and clinging.</p>
<p id="dn1note17">17. The question as to whether a Tathāgata exists, doesn’t exist, both, or neither is one that the Buddha, too, refuses to take a stand on, but his refusal is based on knowledge, not on stupidity. See the discussion in <a href="/books/SkillInQuestions/Section0013.html"><em>Skill in Questions,</em> Chapter 8</a> and <a href="/books/SkillInQuestions/Section0018.html">Appendix 4</a>.</p>
<p id="dn1note18">18. The doctrine of fortuitous arising is a simple case of wrong view. Both the cosmos and the sense of self arise because of causes. In the case of the sense of self, these causes can come from previous lifetimes.</p>
<p id="dn1note19">19. Mentioned in <a href="/suttas/DN/DN15.html">DN 15</a>.</p>
<p id="dn1note20">20. <a href="/suttas/MN/MN102.html">MN 102</a> contains a fuller description of the discussions among the Buddha’s contemporaries as to whether the self is percipient, non-percipient, or neither percipient nor non-percipient after death. The Buddha himself discusses the afterlife, not in terms of what the self is, but of the various types of rebirth—percipient, non-percipient, or neither percipient nor non-percipient, pleasant or unpleasant—that can occur based on one’s kamma. As for the arahant after death, Upasīva in <a href="/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp5_6.html">Sn 5:6</a> asks whether the person who has reached the goal doesn’t exist or remains for eternity. In response, the Buddha states that when a person does away with all dhammas, no means of speaking apply.</p>
<p id="dn1note21">21. Upasīva’s question in <a href="/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp5_6.html">Sn 5:6</a> suggests that “undiseased” in this context means that the self would remain in that condition, unchanging, for eternity.</p>
<p id="dn1note22">22. In <a href="/suttas/DN/DN09.html">DN 9</a>, the Buddha heaps ridicule on the proponents of this position.</p>
<p id="dn1note23">23. Annihilationism is, in many parts of the Canon, paired with eternalism as a particularly evil form of wrong view because it denies the long-term consequences of kamma after death. The positions taken by the theorists described in this section are based on how they define the self. From that definition, they conclude that the self cannot survive death. The Buddha, however—unlike other thinkers of his time—never defines <em>what</em> is reborn, and focuses instead on <em>how</em> rebirth happens. See <em><a href="/ebook_index.html#truthofrebirth">The Truth of Rebirth</a>.</em></p>
<p>Also, the positions taken here answer a pair of questions that the Buddha refuses to take a position on: whether the soul (or: life-force, <em>jīva)</em> is the same as the body or something different from the body. See <a href="/suttas/MN/MN63.html">MN 63</a>.</p>
<p id="dn1note24">24. <em>Sant satta:</em> a being as a discrete metaphysical entity, as opposed to a being described as a process. See the discussion in <a href="/books/SkillInQuestions/Section0018.html"><em>Skill in Questions,</em> Appendix 4</a>.</p>
<p id="dn1note25">25. The elementary properties of earth (solidity), water (liquidity), wind (energy), and fire (warmth). In other words, this view is the materialist view that identifies the self with the physical body.</p>
<p id="dn1note26">26. This apparently corresponds to the sense of the body as experienced from inside, as in any of the four jhānas.</p>
<p id="dn1note27">27. This and the following attainments are the formless states that can be attained based on the attainment of the fourth jhāna (<a href="/suttas/MN/MN140.html">MN 140</a>) or the “property of beauty” (<a href="/suttas/SN/SN14_11.html">SN 14:11</a>, <a href="/suttas/DN/DN15.html">DN 15</a>).</p>
<p id="dn1note28">28. As <a href="/suttas/MN/MN106.html">MN 106</a> points out, this attainment can be reached through the contemplation of not-self in the six sense media.</p>
<p id="dn1note29">29. The views in this section are wrong on two counts: (1) They describe unbinding as pertaining to an existing being (see <a href="#dn1note23">note 23</a>). This is wrong because a “being” is defined by its desires and attachments (see <a href="/suttas/SN/SN23_2.html">SN 23:2</a>), whereas unbinding is free of desires and attachments. (2) They equate unbinding with experiences that are fabricated, and therefore stressful, whereas unbinding in the Buddhist sense is unfabricated and free of suffering and stress.</p>
<p id="dn1note30">30. Māgaṇḍiya puts forth this view in <a href="/suttas/MN/MN75.html">MN 75</a>. <a href="/suttas/MN/MN13.html">MN 13</a> and <a href="/suttas/MN/MN45.html">MN 45</a> list some of the dangers that can come from viewing sensual pleasure as a worthwhile goal.</p>
<p id="dn1note31">31. The four jhānas described in this section are identical with the description of right concentration. However, because they are accompanied by wrong view, they are not noble right concentration (see <a href="/suttas/MN/MN117.html">MN 117</a>). In other words, until the view is changed, these states of concentration cannot lead to awakening. Some people read this passage as a warning that a person experiencing jhāna may become so enamored of it that he/she will refuse to practice further. However, although the Buddha does note that people attaining jhāna can get stuck there (see <a href="/suttas/AN/AN4_178.html">AN 4:178</a>), he also notes in <a href="/suttas/MN/MN14.html">MN 14</a> that unless one has attained at least the pleasure of the first jhāna, one will not be able to overcome attachment to sensuality. And the dangers of attachment to sensuality that he lists in that sutta are far worse than the dangers of being attached to jhāna.</p>
<p>It’s strange that none of the formless attainments are listed in this section, as these, too, are often confused with the experience of true unbinding. On this point, see the discussion of the non-duality of consciousness in <a href="/suttas/AN/AN10_29.html">AN 10:29</a>.</p>

<p id="dn1note33">33. The sequence of conditions here is drawn from the teachings on dependent co-arising. For two different lists of all the conditions, see <a href="/suttas/DN/DN15.html">DN 15</a> and <a href="/suttas/SN/SN12_2.html">SN 12:2</a>.</p>

<p id="dn1note35">35. <a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_86.html">SN 22:86</a> states that the unestablished consciousness of an arahant after death cannot be located. <a href="/suttas/SN/SN12_64.html">SN 12:64</a> illustrates this point with the image of a beam of light that is “unestablished”—i.e., that does not land on any object. See also <a href="/suttas/DN/DN11.html">DN 11</a> and <a href="/suttas/MN/MN49.html">MN 49</a> on the topic of consciousness without surface.</p>
