          <h1>The Great Meeting<br />Mahā Samaya Sutta&#160;&#160;(DN&#160;20)</h1>
          <h2 class="intro">Introduction</h2>
          <p><em>This discourse is an interesting example of the folklore of the Pali Canon. It shows that the tendency of Asian popular Buddhism to regard the Buddha as a protective figure, and not just as a teacher, has its roots in the earliest part of the tradition. Metrical analysis indicates that the long “tribute” section of this discourse is very old, while the verses in the introductory section—which is also found in the Saṁyutta Nikāya—are later. This fits with a more subjective judgment: that the tribute was an earlier composition, to which the introduction was added at a later date. This judgment is based on the fact that the two sections do not quite fit each other. The introduction to the tribute indicates that the reciter of the tribute is the Buddha himself, whereas the narration in the tribute indicates otherwise. The style of the tribute—with its repeated stanzas and tropes—also falls into the ancient genre of verses celebrating a king’s victory over his enemies</em></p>
          <p><em>At any rate, this discourse is the closest thing in the Pali Canon to a “who’s who” of the deva worlds, and should provide useful material for anyone interested in the cosmology of early Buddhism.</em></p>
          <p><em>The Commentary reports the belief that devas still enjoy hearing this discourse chanted in Pali. Until recently it was part of many monks’ standard memorized repertoire, to be chanted at weddings and the dedication of new buildings. Even today, as many of the traditions of memorization in Asia seem to be falling by the wayside, there are a few monks and laypeople who chant this discourse regularly.</em></p>
          <p class="stars">*&#160;*&#160;*</p>
          <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Forest, together with a large Saṅgha of approximately five hundred monks, all of them arahants. And most of the devatās from ten world-systems had gathered in order to see the Blessed One &amp; the Saṅgha of monks.</p>
          <p>Then the thought occurred to four devatās of the ranks from the Pure Abodes: “The Blessed One is dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Forest, together with a large Saṅgha of about five hundred monks, all of them arahants. And most of the devatās from ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Blessed One &amp; the Saṅgha of monks. Let us also approach the Blessed One and, on arrival, let us each speak a verse in his presence.”</p>
          <p>Then, just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, those devatās disappeared from among the Devas of the Pure Abodes and reappeared before the Blessed One. Having paid homage to him, they stood to one side. As they were standing there, one devatā recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:</p>
          <div class="verse">
            <p>“A great meeting in the woods:</p>
            <p>The deva hosts have assembled.</p>
            <p>We have come to this Dhamma meeting</p>
            <p>to see the unvanquished Saṅgha.”</p>
          </div>
          <p>Then another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:</p>
          <div class="verse">
            <p>“There the monks are concentrated,</p>
            <p>have straightened their own minds.</p>
            <p>Like a charioteer holding the reins,</p>
            <p>the wise ones guard their faculties.”</p>
          </div>
          <p>Then another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:</p>
          <div class="verse">
            <p>“Having cut through barrenness, cut the cross-bar,</p>
            <p>having uprooted Indra’s pillar, unstirred,</p>
            <p>they wander about pure, unstained,</p>
            <p>young nāgas<span class="fn"><a href="#dn20note01">1</a></span><!--end fn cite--> well tamed by the One with Eyes.”</p>
          </div>
          <p>Then another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:</p>
          <div class="verse">
            <p>“Those who have gone to the Buddha for refuge</p>
            <p>will not go to the plane of woe.</p>
            <p>On discarding the human body,</p>
            <p>they will fill the hosts of the devas.”</p>
          </div>
          <p>Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, most of the devatās</p>
          <p>from ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Tathāgata &amp; the Saṅgha of monks. Those who, in the past, were Worthy Ones, Rightly Self-</p>
          <p>awakened, at most had their devatā-gathering like mine at the present. Those</p>
          <p>who, in the future, will be Worthy Ones, Rightly Self-awakened, will at most have their devatā-gathering like mine at the present.</p>
          <p>“I will tell you the names of the deva hosts. I will describe to you the names of the deva hosts. I will teach you the names of the deva hosts. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak.”</p>
          <p>“As you say, lord,” the monks responded to the Blessed One.</p>
          <p>The Blessed One said:</p>
          <div class="verse">
            <p>I will recite a verse of tribute.</p>
            <p>Those who live where spirits dwell,</p>
            <p>who live in mountain caves, resolute, concentrated,</p>
            <p>many, like hidden lions, who have overcome horripilation,</p>
            <p>white-hearted, pure, serene, &amp; undisturbed:</p>
            <div class="verse-add">
              <p>Knowing that more than 500 of them</p>
              <p>had come to the forest of Kapilavatthu,</p>
              <p>the Teacher then said to them,</p>
              <p>disciples delighting in his instruction,</p>
              <p>“The deva hosts have approached. Detect them, monks!”</p>
              <p>Listening to the Awakened One’s instruction,</p>
              <p class="v1">they made an ardent effort.</p>
              <p>Knowledge appeared to them, vision of non-human beings.</p>
              <p>Some saw 100, some 1,000, some 70,000,</p>
              <p>some had vision of 100,000 non-human beings.</p>
              <p>Some gained vision of innumerable devas</p>
              <p class="v1">filling every direction.</p>

            <div class="verse-add">
              <p class="v1">Realizing all this,</p>
              <p>the One-with-Vision felt moved to speak.</p>
              <p>The Teacher then said to them,</p>

            <p id="dn20note01">1. Here <em>nāga</em> means “Great Being.” It is frequently used in this sense as an epithet for arahants. The verse containing this line is set in one of the most complex meters found in the Pali Canon.</p>

Their accounts of why they hold these views incidentally show what “corrupted by play” and “corrupted by mind” mean:</p>
            <div class="iblock">
              <p>“Those honorable devas who are not corrupted by play don’t spend an excessive amount of time indulging in the delights of laughter &amp; play. Because they don’t spend an excessive amount of time indulging in the delights of laughter &amp; play, their mindfulness doesn’t become muddled. Because of unmuddled mindfulness, they don’t fall from that company. They are constant, permanent, eternal, not subject to change, and will stay just like that as long as eternity. But those of us who were corrupted by play spent an excessive amount of time indulging in the delights of laughter &amp; play. Because we spent an excessive amount of time indulging in the delights of laughter &amp; play, our mindfulness became muddled. Because of muddled mindfulness, we fell from that company and—inconstant, impermanent, short-lived, subject to falling—have come to this world.’” — <em><a href="/suttas/DN/DN01.html">DN&#160;1</a></em></p>

Because they are uncorrupted in mind toward one another, they don’t grow exhausted in body or exhausted in mind. They don’t fall from that company. They are constant, permanent, eternal, not subject to change, and will stay just like that as long as eternity.

            <p id="dn20note04">4.  <a href="/suttas/DN/DN01.html">DN&#160;1</a> tells how the Great Brahmā appears spontaneously at the beginning of an eon, and how he and his retinue become deluded about his creative powers:</p>
            <div class="iblock">
              <p>“There ultimately comes a time when, with the passing of a long stretch of time, this world devolves. When the world is devolving, beings for the most part head toward the Radiant (Brahmās). There they stay: mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, coursing through the air, established in beauty for a long stretch of time. Then there ultimately comes a time when, with the passing of a long stretch of time, this world evolves. When the world is evolving, an empty Brahmā palace appears. Then a certain being—from the exhaustion of his life span or the exhaustion of his merit—falls from the company of the Radiant and re-arises in the empty Brahmā palace. And there he still stays mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, coursing through the air, established in beauty for a long stretch of time.</p>
              <p>“After dwelling there alone for a long time, he experiences displeasure &amp; agitation: ‘O, if only other beings would come to this world!’</p>
              <p>“Then other beings, through the ending of their life span or the ending of their merit, fall from the company of the Radiant and reappear in the Brahmā palace, in the company of that being. And there they still stay mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, coursing through the air, established in beauty for a long stretch of time.</p>
              <p>“Then the thought occurred to the being who reappeared first: ‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. These beings were created by me. Why is that? First the thought occurred to me, “O, if only other beings would come to this world!” And thus my direction of will brought these beings to this world.’ As for the beings who reappear later, this thought occurred to them: ‘This is Brahmā… Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. We were created by this Brahmā. Why is that? We saw that he appeared here before, while we appeared after.’ The being who reappeared first was of longer life span, more beautiful, &amp; more influential, while the beings who reappeared later were of shorter life span, less beautiful, &amp; less influential.” — <em><a href="/suttas/DN/DN01.html">DN&#160;1</a></em></p>
