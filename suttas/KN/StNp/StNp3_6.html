            <h1 id="StNp3.6">3:6 &#160;Sabhiya</h1>
            <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Now on that occasion, questions had been assigned to Sabhiya the wanderer by a devatā who was a former relative of his: “Sabhiya, if any contemplative or brahman, when asked these questions, answers them, live the holy life in his presence.” Then Sabhiya the wanderer, having learned these questions in the presence of that devatā, went to those who had communities &amp; groups, who were the teachers of groups, well-known, prestigious, founders of sects, well-regarded by people at large—i.e., Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambalin, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Velaṭṭhaputta, &amp; the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—and asked them the questions. But they, being asked the questions by Sabhiya the wanderer, were unable to answer. Unable to answer, they showed anger, aversion, &amp; displeasure, and even turned the questions back on Sabhiya the wanderer.</p>
            <p>The thought occurred to Sabhiya the wanderer, “These venerable contemplatives &amp; brahmans with communities &amp; groups, who are the teachers of groups, well-known, prestigious, founders of sects, well-regarded by people at large—i.e., Pūraṇa Kassapa … &amp; the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—when asked these questions by me are unable to answer. Unable to answer, they show anger, aversion, &amp; displeasure, and even turn the questions back on me. What if I were to revert to the lower life and partake of sensual pleasures?”</p>
            <p>But then the thought occurred to him, “There is still this Gotama the contemplative. He has a community &amp; group, he is the teacher of a group, well-known, prestigious, founder of a sect, well-regarded by people at large. What if I, having gone to him, were to ask <em>him</em> these questions?”</p>
            <p>Then the thought occurred to Sabhiya the wanderer, “Now, those venerable contemplatives &amp; brahmans—Pūraṇa Kassapa … &amp; the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta—are old, elderly, aged, along in their years, at an advanced stage of life, elders, senior, long gone forth, with communities &amp; groups, teachers of groups, well-known, prestigious, founders of sects, well-regarded by people at large: Even they, when asked these questions by me, were unable to answer. Unable to answer, they showed anger, aversion, &amp; displeasure, and even turned the questions back on me. So how could this Gotama the contemplative answer when asked these questions? He is both young in age and newly gone forth.”</p>
            <p>But then the thought occurred to him, “Gotama the contemplative is not to be despised as ‘young’ or treated with contempt. Even though young, he is of great power &amp; great might.<span class="fn"><a href="#stnp_note3.6.01">1</a></span><!--end fn cite--> What if I, having gone to him, were to ask him these questions?”</p>
            <p>So Sabhiya the wanderer set out, headed for Rājagaha. Wandering by stages, he arrived at where the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he addressed the Blessed One in verse:</p>
            <div class="verse">
              <p>“Doubtful &amp; uncertain, I have come</p>
              <p>desiring to ask questions.</p>
              <p>Put an end to them,</p>
              <p>when asked them by me.</p>
              <p>Answer me&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;one-by-one,</p>
              <p class="v3">in line with the Dhamma.”</p>
              <div class="verse-add">
                <p>“Sabhiya,” said the Blessed One,</p>
                <p>“you have come from afar,</p>
                <p>desiring to ask questions.</p>
                <p>I will put an end to them,</p>
                <p>when asked them by you.</p>
                <p>I will answer you&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;one-by-one,</p>
                <p class="v3">in line with the Dhamma.”</p>
              </div><!--end verse-add-->
            </div><!--end verse-->
            <p>Then the thought occurred to Sabhiya the wanderer, “Isn’t is amazing? Isn’t it astounding?—how even the leave, of which I didn’t receive even a little bit from other contemplatives &amp; brahmans, has been granted to me by Gotama the contemplative.” Gratified, joyful, exultant, enraptured, &amp; happy, he asked the Blessed One a question:</p>
            <div class="verse">
              <p>“Having attained what</p>

              <p>And how is one said to be tamed?</p>
              <p>How is one called ‘awakened’?</p>
              <p>Answer, Blessed One, when I’ve asked you.”</p>

            <p>Then Sabhiya the wanderer, bending his head to the Blessed One’s feet, said, “Magnificent, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to the Saṅgha of monks. Let me obtain the Going-forth in the Blessed One’s presence, let me obtain Acceptance.”</p>
            <p>“Anyone, Sabhiya, who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the Going-forth &amp; Acceptance into this Dhamma &amp; Vinaya, must first undergo probation for four months. If, at the end of four months, the monks feel so moved, they give him the Going-forth &amp; accept him into the monk’s state. But I know distinctions among individuals in this matter.”</p>
            <p>“Lord, if that is so, I am willing to undergo probation for four years. If, at the end of four years, the monks feel so moved, let them give me the Going-forth &amp; accept me into the monk’s state.”</p>
            <p>Then Sabhiya the wanderer obtained the Going-forth in the Blessed One’s presence, he obtained Acceptance. And not long after his Acceptance—dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute—he in no long time reached &amp; remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing &amp; realizing it for himself in the here-&amp;-now. He knew: “Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world.” And so Ven. Sabhiya became another one of the arahants.</p>

              <p id="stnp_note3.6.03">3. <em>Ussada:</em> According to SnA, this means such forms of defilement as passion, aversion, delusion, pride, and conceit. See <a href="../../../suttas/KN/StNp/StNp4_14.html">Sn 4:14</a>.</p>

              <p id="stnp_note3.6.06">6. This verse contains an end-rhyme—<em>visuddhaṁ/Buddhaṁ</em>—which is rare in Pali poetry.</p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.07">7. Here there is alliteration between <em>bāhetvā</em> (banished) and <em>brahmā</em> (brahman, shortened to fit the meter). A similar alliteration is found in <a href="../../../suttas/KN/Dhp/Ch26.html#dhp388">Dhp&#160;388</a> and <a href="../../../suttas/KN/Ud/ud1_4.html">Ud&#160;1:4–5</a>.</p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.08">8. Here there is alliteration between <em>samitāvi</em> (calmed) and <em>samaṇo</em> (contemplative).</p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.09">9. Here there is alliteration between <em>n’eti,</em> “doesn’t come/go” and <em>nhātako,</em> “washed.” This verse also contains a play on words. Normally, one would say that a person is washed of dirt <em>(uklāpa);</em> here the arahant is said to be washed of theory <em>(kappa).</em></p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.10">10. The Pali phrase here is <em>āguṁ na karoti,</em> which could be rephrased as <em>na āguṁ karoti,</em> yielding a play on the word <em>nāga.</em> The same play on words is found in <a href="../../../suttas/AN/AN6_43.html">AN&#160;6:43</a>. Given that one of the meanings of nāga is “large elephant,” the verse here further elaborates on the image evoked by the word by depicting the nāga as freed from all fetters and bonds.</p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.11">11. SnA cites this passage from <a href="../../../suttas/AN/AN3_77.html">AN&#160;3:77</a> to identify “field,” here, with kamma: “Kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture.” In the context of that sutta, this analogy is used to explain the way different levels of becoming are produced.</p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.12">12. As with “field,” SnA identifies “storehouses” as storehouses of kamma. Here there is alliteration between <em>kosāni</em> (storehouses) and <em>kusalo</em> (skillful).</p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.13">13. <em>Paṇḍara = Pāṇdura</em> (Skt.): <em>Anogeissus Latifolia.</em> According to SnA, “white flowers” stands for the six sense media, in that they are normally pure and yet can grow (see <a href="../../../suttas/SN/SN22_54.html">SN&#160;22:54</a>). An alternative possibility is that “white flowers” stands for states of mind marked by a perception of whiteness—such as the white-totality, and the mastery described in <a href="../../../suttas/AN/AN10_29.html">AN&#160;10:29</a> as follows: </p>
              <div class="iblock">

                <p>“One percipient of the formless internally sees forms externally as white, white in their color, white in their features, white in their glow. Just as the morning star is white, white in its color, white in its features, white in its glow, or just as Vārāṇasī muslin, smooth on both sides, is white, white in its color, white in its features, white in its glow, in the same way one percipient of the formless internally sees forms externally as white, white in their color, white in their features, white in their glow.

              <p>As <a href="../../../suttas/AN/AN10_29.html">AN&#160;10:29</a> further notes, this is the highest state of mastery, “yet even in the beings who are percipient in this way there is still aberration, there is change. Seeing this, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with that. Being disenchanted with that, he becomes dispassionate toward what is supreme, and even more so toward what is inferior.” As the verse here notes, a person going beyond this state would have to go beyond all states of darkness and brightness to attain release.</p>
              <p>This verse contains an alliteration that can, without force, be replicated in English: white flowers <em>(paṇdarāni)</em> and wise <em>(paṇdito).</em></p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.14">14<em>.</em> Here there is a play on words with <em>vedāni</em> (knowledges) and <em>vedanā</em> (feelings).</p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.15">15. See <a href="../../../suttas/MN/MN18.html">MN&#160;18</a>, introduction.</p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.16">16. Reading <em>vīro</em> with GD, rather than <em>dhīro,</em> which is found in the printed editions but doesn’t seem to fit the context. (See the note in GD to verse 44 in <a href="../../../suttas/KN/StNp/StNp1_3.html">Sn 1:3</a>, which comments on the tendency of the textual tradition to confuse these two words.) This reading would give the verse three alliterated words: <em>virato</em> (abstaining), <em>viriyavā</em> (one with persistence), and <em>vīro</em> (hero).</p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.17">17. “Having directly known, for the sake of direct knowing”: Two meanings of the word <em>abhiññāya.</em></p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.18">18. Here there is an alliteration between <em>sutavā</em> (having heard) and <em>sottiyo</em> (learned). </p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.19">19. SnA identifies “mud” as the strings of sensuality, and the three types of perception as the three beginning with the perception of sensuality. These could be either the perceptions of sensuality, ill-will, and harmfulness, or the perceptions of sensuality, form, and formlessness.</p>
              <p>The alliteration in this verse is between <em>ālayāni</em> (attachments) and <em>ariyo</em> (noble).</p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.20">20. This verse contains an alliteration between <em>paribbājayitvā</em> (avoiding) and <em>paribbājaka</em> (wanderer).</p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.21">21. According to SnA, the 63 wrong views comprise the 62 wrong views mentioned in <a href="../../../suttas/DN/DN01.html">DN&#160;1</a> along with the wrong view of self-identity <em>(sakkāya-diṭṭhi).</em></p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.22">22. According to SnA, these are classes of devas noted for their discernment.</p>
              <p id="stnp_note3.6.23">23. See <a href="../../../suttas/AN/AN11_10.html">AN&#160;11:10</a>.</p>
