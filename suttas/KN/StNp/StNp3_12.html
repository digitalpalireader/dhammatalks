            <h1 id="StNp3.12">3:12 &#160;The Contemplation of Dualities</h1>
            <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migāra’s mother. Now on that occasion—the uposatha day of the fifteenth, a perfect full-moon night—the Blessed One was sitting in the open air surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. Surveying the silent Saṅgha of monks, he addressed them: “Monks, if there are any who ask, ‘Your listening to teachings that are skillful, noble, leading onward, going to self-awakening is a prerequisite for what?’ they should be told, ‘For the sake of knowing qualities of dualities as they actually are.’ Which duality are you speaking about? ‘This is stress. This is the origination of stress’: This is one contemplation. ‘This is the cessation of stress. This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress’: This is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&amp;-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”</p>
            <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>
            <div class="verse">
              <p>“Those who don’t discern stress,</p>

              <p class="v1">without trace;</p>
              <p>who don’t know the path,</p>

For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute—one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here-&amp;-now, or—if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance—non-return.”</p>
            <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>
            <div class="verse">
              <p>“Those who journey the wandering-on</p>

            <p>“Now, if there are any who ask, ‘Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?’ they should be told, ‘There would.’ How would that be? ‘Whatever stress comes into play is all from fabrication as a requisite condition’: This is one contemplation. ‘From the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very fabrication, there is no coming into play of stress’: This is a second contemplation.

              <p id="stnp_note3.12.02">2. The term ‘acquisition’ <em>(upadhi),</em> in its everyday sense, denotes the possessions, baggage, and other paraphernalia that a nomadic family might carry around with it in its wanderings. On the psychological level, it denotes anything for which one might have a sense of ‘I’ or ‘mine’ and which, consequently, one would carry around as a kind of mental baggage. The verse following this prose passage is identical with the Buddha’s first answer to Mettagū in <a href="/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp5_4.html">Sn 5:4</a>.</p>

              <p id="stnp_note3.12.05">5. “There are these four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be born.
