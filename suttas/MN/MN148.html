            <h1>The Six Sextets<br />
              Chachakka Sutta&#160;&#160;(MN&#160;148)</h1>
            <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. There he addressed the monks: “Monks!”</p>
            <p>“Yes, lord,” the monks responded to him.</p>
            <p>“Monks, I will teach you the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; I will expound the holy life both in its particulars &amp; in its essence, entirely complete, surpassingly pure—in other words, the six sextets. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak.”</p>
            <p>“As you say, lord,” the monks responded to him.</p>
            <p>The Blessed One said: “The six internal media should be known. The six external media should be known. The six classes of consciousness should be known. The six classes of contact should be known. The six classes of feeling should be known. The six classes of craving should be known.</p>
            <p>“‘The six internal media should be known.’ Thus it was said. In reference to what was it said? The eye-medium, the ear-medium, the nose-medium, the tongue-medium, the body-medium, the intellect-medium. ‘The six internal media should be known.’ Thus it was said. And in reference to this was it said. This is the first sextet.</p>
            <p>“‘The six external media should be known.’ Thus it was said. In reference to what was it said? The form-medium, the sound-medium, the aroma-medium, the flavor-medium, the tactile sensation-medium, the idea-medium. ‘The six external media should be known.’ Thus it was said. And in reference to this was it said. This is the second sextet.</p>
            <p>“‘The six classes of consciousness should be known.’ Thus it was said. In reference to what was it said? Dependent on the eye &amp; forms there arises consciousness at the eye. Dependent on the ear &amp; sounds there arises consciousness at the ear. Dependent on the nose &amp; aromas there arises consciousness at the nose. Dependent on the tongue &amp; flavors there arises consciousness at the tongue. Dependent on the body &amp; tactile sensations there arises consciousness at the body. Dependent on the intellect &amp; ideas there arises consciousness at the intellect. ‘The six classes of consciousness should be known.’ Thus it was said. And in reference to this was it said. This is the third sextet.</p>
            <p>“‘The six classes of contact should be known.’ Thus it was said. In reference to what was it said? Dependent on the eye &amp; forms there arises consciousness at the eye. The meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the ear &amp; sounds there arises consciousness at the ear. The meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the nose &amp; aromas there arises consciousness at the nose. The meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the tongue &amp; flavors there arises consciousness at the tongue. The meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the body &amp; tactile sensations there arises consciousness at the body. The meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the intellect &amp; ideas there arises consciousness at the intellect. The meeting of the three is contact. ‘The six classes of contact should be known.’ Thus it was said. And in reference to this was it said. This is the fourth sextet.</p>
            <p>“‘The six classes of feeling should be known.’ Thus it was said. In reference to what was it said? Dependent on the eye &amp; forms there arises consciousness at the eye. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition there is feeling. Dependent on the ear &amp; sounds there arises consciousness at the ear. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition there is feeling. Dependent on the nose &amp; aromas there arises consciousness at the nose. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition there is feeling. Dependent on the tongue &amp; flavors there arises consciousness at the tongue.

The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition there is feeling. ‘The six classes of feeling should be known.’ Thus it was said. And in reference to this was it said. This is the fifth sextet.</p>
            <p>“‘The six classes of craving should be known.’ Thus it was said. In reference to what was it said? Dependent on the eye &amp; forms there arises consciousness at the eye.

            <p>“This, monks, is the path of practice leading to self-identification.

            <p>“Dependent on the eye &amp; forms there arises consciousness at the eye. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition, there arises what is felt either as pleasure, pain, or neither pleasure nor pain. If, when touched by a feeling of pleasure, one relishes it, welcomes it, or remains fastened to it, then one’s passion-obsession gets obsessed. If, when touched by a feeling of pain, one sorrows, grieves, &amp; laments, beats one’s breast, becomes distraught, then one’s resistance-obsession gets obsessed. If, when touched by a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain, one does not discern, as it has come to be, the origination, passing away, allure, drawback, or escape from that feeling, then one’s ignorance-obsession gets obsessed. That a person—without abandoning passion-obsession with regard to a feeling of pleasure, without abolishing resistance-obsession with regard to a feeling of pain, without uprooting ignorance-obsession with regard to a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain, without abandoning ignorance and giving rise to clear knowing—would put an end to suffering &amp; stress in the here &amp; now: Such a thing isn’t possible.</p>

            <p>“He grows disenchanted with the intellect, disenchanted with ideas, disenchanted with consciousness at the intellect, disenchanted with contact at the intellect, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with craving. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is released. With release, there is the knowledge, ‘Released.’ He discerns that ‘Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.’”</p>
            <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted at his words. And while this explanation was being given, the hearts of sixty monks, through lack of clinging/sustenance, were released from effluents.</p>
