            <h1>To Bhūmija<br />
              Bhūmija Sutta&#160;&#160;(MN&#160;126)</h1>
            <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Forest, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>Then, early in the morning, Ven. Bhūmija—having adjusted his lower robe and taking his bowl &amp; outer robe—went to Prince Jayasena’s residence.<span class="fn"><a href="#mn126note01">1</a></span><!--end fn cite--> On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready. Prince Jayasena went to Ven. Bhūmija and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to Ven. Bhūmija, “Master Bhūmija, there are some contemplatives &amp; brahmans who espouse this teaching, espouse this view: ‘If one follows the holy life, even when having made a wish (for results), one is incapable of obtaining results. If one follows the holy life even when having made no wish, one is incapable of obtaining results. If one follows the holy life even when both having made a wish and having made no wish, one is incapable of obtaining results. If one follows the holy life even when neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, one is incapable of obtaining results.’<span class="fn"><a href="#mn126note02">2</a></span><!--end fn cite--> With regard to that, what does Master Bhūmija’s teacher say, what is his view, what does he declare?”</p>
            <p>“I haven’t heard this face to face with the Blessed One, prince, I haven’t received this face to face with the Blessed One, but there is the possibility that the Blessed One would answer in this way: ‘If one follows the holy life inappropriately, even when having made a wish (for results), one is incapable of obtaining results. If one follows the holy life inappropriately, even when having made no wish… both having made a wish and having made no wish… neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, one is incapable of obtaining results. (But) if one follows the holy life appropriately, even when having made a wish, one is capable of obtaining results. If one follows the holy life appropriately, even when having made no wish… both having made a wish and having made no wish… neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, one is capable of obtaining results.’ I haven’t heard this face to face with the Blessed One, I haven’t received this face to face with the Blessed One, but there is the possibility that the Blessed One would answer in this way.”</p>
            <p>“If that is what Master Bhūmija’s teacher says, if that is his view, if that is what he declares, then yes, Master Bhūmija’s teacher stands, as it were, having struck all of those many contemplatives &amp; brahmans down by the head.”</p>
            <p>Prince Jayasena then served Ven. Bhūmija from his own dish of milk rice.</p>
            <p>Then Ven. Bhūmija, after his meal, returning from his almsround, went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: “Just now, lord, early in the morning—having adjusted my lower robe and taking my bowl &amp; outer robe—I went to Prince Jayasena’s residence. On arrival, I sat down on a seat made ready. Then Prince Jayasena went to me and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with me. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to me, ‘Master Bhūmija, there are some contemplatives &amp; brahmans who espouse this teaching, espouse this view: “If one follows the holy life even when having made a wish (for results)… having made no wish… both having made a wish and having made no wish… neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, one is incapable of obtaining results.” With regard to that, what does Master Bhūmija’s teacher say, what is his view, what does he declare?’</p>
            <p>“When this was said, I replied to Prince Jayasena, ‘I haven’t heard this face to face with the Blessed One, prince, I haven’t received this face to face with the Blessed One, but there is the possibility that the Blessed One would answer in this way: “If one follows the holy life inappropriately, even when having made a wish (for results)… having made no wish… both having made a wish and having made no wish… neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, one is incapable of obtaining results. (But) if one follows the holy life appropriately, even when having made a wish… having made no wish… both having made a wish and having made no wish… neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, one is capable of obtaining results.” I haven’t heard this face to face with the Blessed One, I haven’t received this face to face with the Blessed One, but there is the possibility that the Blessed One would answer in this way.’</p>
            <p>“‘If that is what Master Bhūmija’s teacher says, if that is his view, if that is what he declares, then yes, Master Bhūmija’s teacher stands, as it were, having struck all of those many contemplatives &amp; brahmans down by the head.’</p>
            <p>“Answering in this way when thus asked, lord, am I speaking in line with what the Blessed One has said, am I not misrepresenting the Blessed One with what is unfactual, am I answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me?”</p>
            <p>“Certainly, Bhūmija, in answering in this way when thus asked, you are speaking in line with what I have said, you are not misrepresenting me with what is unfactual, and you are answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing you. For any contemplatives or brahmans endowed with wrong view, wrong resolve, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, &amp; wrong concentration: If they follow the holy life even when having made a wish (for results), they are incapable of obtaining results. If they follow the holy life even when having made no wish, they are incapable of obtaining results. If they follow the holy life even when both having made a wish and having made no wish, they are incapable of obtaining results. If they follow the holy life even when neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, they are incapable of obtaining results. Why is that? Because it is an inappropriate way of obtaining results.</p>

            <p>“Bhūmija, if these four similes had occurred to you in the presence of Prince Jayasena, he would have naturally felt confidence in you and—feeling confidence—would have shown his confidence in you.”</p>
            <p>“But, lord, how could these four similes have occurred to me in the presence of Prince Jayasena, as they are natural to the Blessed One and have never before been heard from him?”</p>
            <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Bhūmija delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</p>

The churn-stick is a small stick that has attached to its end blocks of wood resembling an orange with alternate sections removed. This is twirled in the curds. The water sprinkled on the curds dilutes the buttermilk, which helps separate it from the milk fat left on the blocks of the churn-stick.</p>
