Whatever a sympathetic teacher should do—seeking the welfare of his disciples, out of sympathy for them—that have I done for you. Over there are the roots of trees; over there, empty dwellings. Practice jhāna, monks. Don’t be heedless. Don’t later fall into remorse. This is our message to you all.” <span class="fn"><a href="#sn43note11">11</a></span><!--end fn cite--></p>

                <p id="sn43note01">1. “Now, these three are unfabricated characteristics of what is unfabricated. Which three? No arising is discernable, no passing away is discernable, no alteration while staying is discernable.” — <em><a href="../../suttas/AN/AN3_47.html">AN&#160;3:47</a></em></p>
                <p id="sn43note02">2. See <a href="../../suttas/MN/MN119.html">MN&#160;119</a>.</p>
                <p id="sn43note03">3. See <a href="../../suttas/MN/MN43.html">MN&#160;43</a>, <a href="../../suttas/MN/MN121.html">MN&#160;121</a>, and <a href="../../suttas/SN/SN41_7.html">SN&#160;41:7</a>.</p>
                <p id="sn43note04">4. See <a href="../../suttas/MN/MN43.html">MN&#160;43</a> and <a href="../../suttas/SN/SN41_7.html">SN&#160;41:7</a>.</p>
                <p id="sn43note05">5. See <a href="../../suttas/SN/SN47_10.html">SN&#160;47:10</a>.</p>
                <p id="sn43note06">6. Beginning here, the various paths to the unfabricated correspond to the seven sets of qualities that form the 37 wings to awakening. See <a href="../../suttas/DN/DN16.html">DN&#160;16</a>; <a href="../../suttas/SN/SN45_1.html">SN&#160;45–51</a>.</p>
                <p id="sn43note07">7. Beginning here, the various paths to the unfabricated correspond to the 37 wings to awakening in detail.</p>
                <p id="sn43note08">8. Reading <em>anatañca</em> with the Thai and Burmese editions. The Sri Lankan and PTS editions read <em>anantañca,</em> the unending/infinite. The prior reading seems preferable in that it relates to a passage in <a href="../../suttas/MN/MN19.html">MN&#160;19</a> that describes how the ordinary mind is “bent” by the results of its habitual thinking, whether in a skillful or unskillful direction. The goal, because it lies beyond the influence of any kind of kamma—physical, verbal, or mental—would thus be unbent.</p>
                <p id="sn43note09">9. Consciousness without surface. See <a href="../../suttas/DN/DN11.html">DN&#160;11</a> and <a href="../../suttas/MN/MN49.html">MN&#160;49</a>.</p>
                <p id="sn43note10">10. See <a href="../../suttas/AN/AN4_173.html">AN&#160;4:173</a>.</p>
                <p id="sn43note11">11. The transcribers of the Canon note that all the synonyms for the goal should be understood in full in line with the treatment of the unfabricated. CDB thus counts 44 suttas in this saṁyutta.</p>
