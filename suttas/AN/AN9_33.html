                <p>“Monks, I will teach you the nine step-by-step dwelling-attainments. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak.”</p>
                <p>“As you say, lord,” the monks responded to him.</p>
                <p>The Blessed One said, “And what, monks, are the nine step-by-step dwelling-attainments?</p>
                <p>[1] “Wherever sensual resolves cease and those who repeatedly stop sensual resolves dwell: Surely, I tell you, by that factor those venerable ones are free from hunger, unbound, having crossed over &amp; gone to the far shore.</p>
                <p>“Now if someone should say, ‘Where do sensual resolves cease? And where do those who repeatedly stop sensual resolves dwell? I don’t know that; I don’t see that,’ he should be told, ‘There is the case, friend, where a monk, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful mental qualities, enters &amp; remains in the first jhāna: rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. That is where sensual resolves cease, and where those who repeatedly stop sensual resolves dwell.’ Surely, a person without guile or deceit, (saying,) ‘Very good,’ would delight in &amp; approve of that statement. Delighting in &amp; approving of that statement, paying homage &amp; raising his hands palm-to-palm over his heart, he would honor it.</p>
                <p>[2] “Wherever directed thoughts &amp; evaluations cease and those who repeatedly stop directed thoughts &amp; evaluations dwell: Surely, I tell you, by that factor those venerable ones are free from hunger, unbound, having crossed over &amp; gone to the far shore.</p>

I don’t know that; I don’t see that,’ he should be told, ‘There is the case, friend, where a monk, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, enters &amp; remains in the second jhāna: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation—internal assurance. That is where directed thoughts &amp; evaluations cease, and where those who repeatedly stop directed thoughts &amp; evaluations dwell.’ Surely, a person without guile or deceit, (saying,) ‘Very good,’ would delight in &amp; approve of that statement. Delighting in &amp; approving of that statement, paying homage &amp; raising his hands palm-to-palm over his heart, he would honor it.</p>
                <p>[3] “Wherever rapture ceases and those who repeatedly stop rapture dwell: Surely, I tell you, by that factor those venerable ones are free from hunger, unbound, having crossed over &amp; gone to the far shore.</p>

He enters &amp; remains in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.” That is where rapture ceases, and where those who repeatedly stop rapture dwell.’ Surely, a person without guile or deceit, (saying,) ‘Very good,’ would delight in &amp; approve of that statement. Delighting in &amp; approving of that statement, paying homage &amp; raising his hands palm-to-palm over his heart, he would honor it.</p>
                <p>[4] “Wherever the pleasure of equanimity<span class="fn"><a href="#an9.33note01">1</a></span><!--end fn cite--> ceases and those who repeatedly stop the pleasure of equanimity dwell: Surely, I tell you, by that factor those venerable ones are free from hunger, unbound, having crossed over &amp; gone to the far shore.</p>

I don’t know that; I don’t see that,’ he should be told, ‘There is the case, friend, where a monk, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain—as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress—enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. That is where the pleasure of equanimity ceases, and where those who repeatedly stop the pleasure of equanimity dwell.’ Surely, a person without guile or deceit, (saying,) ‘Very good,’ would delight in &amp; approve of that statement. Delighting in &amp; approving of that statement, paying homage &amp; raising his hands palm-to-palm over his heart, he would honor it.</p>

                  <p id="an9.33note01">1. This observation—that the <em>pleasure</em> of equanimity is abandoned in the fourth jhāna—is also found in <a href="/suttas/MN/MN66.html">MN&#160;66</a> and <a href="/suttas/AN/AN9_42.html">AN&#160;9:42</a>.</p>
                  <p id="an9.33note02">2. “Resistance” is a translation of the Pali term, <em>paṭigha.</em> According to <a href="/suttas/DN/DN15.html">DN&#160;15</a>, resistance-contact results from the characteristics of form and allows mental activity to know the presence of form. In other words, if form did not put up resistance to something else taking its place, one would not know that form is present. Thus, the disappearance of perceptions of resistance aids in the mind’s ability to transcend perceptions of form and to sense, in its place, infinite space.</p>
                  <p id="an9.33note03">3. “Multiplicity” is a translation of the Pali term, <em>nānattā.</em> <a href="/suttas/MN/MN137.html">MN&#160;137</a> identifies multiplicity as the input of the five physical senses.</p>
                  <p id="an9.33note04">4. Notice that this description of the cessation of perception &amp; feeling lacks the statement often added in passages where this attainment is described: “and, as he sees (that) with discernment, his effluents are completely ended.”</p>
