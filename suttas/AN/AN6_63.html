                <p>“As you say, lord,” the monks responded to the Blessed One.</p>
                <p>The Blessed One said: “And which penetrative explanation is a Dhamma explanation?</p>
                <p>“Sensuality should be known. The cause by which sensuality comes into play should be known. The diversity in sensuality should be known. The result of sensuality should be known.

                <p>“There are these five strings of sensuality. Which five? Forms cognizable via the eye—agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire; sounds cognizable via the ear… aromas cognizable via the nose… flavors cognizable via the tongue… tactile sensations cognizable via the body—agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire. But these are not sensuality. They are called strings of sensuality in the discipline of the noble ones.</p>

                <p>“And what is the cause by which kamma comes into play? Contact is the cause by which kamma comes into play.</p>
                <p>“And what is the diversity in kamma? There is kamma to be experienced in hell, kamma to be experienced in the realm of common animals, kamma to be experienced in the realm of the hungry ghosts, kamma to be experienced in the human world, kamma to be experienced in the world of the devas. This is called the diversity in kamma.</p>
                <p>“And what is the result of kamma? The result of kamma is of three sorts, I tell you: that which arises right here &amp; now, that which arises later (in this lifetime), and that which arises following that. This is called the result of kamma.</p>
                <p>“And what is the cessation of kamma?

The cessation of stress should be known. The path of practice for the cessation of stress should be known.’ Thus it has been said. In reference to what was it said?</p>
                <p>“Birth is stress, aging is stress, death is stress; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair are stress; association with what is not loved is stress, separation from what is loved is stress, not getting what is wanted is stress. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stress.</p>
                <p>“And what is the cause by which stress comes into play? Craving is the cause by which stress comes into play.</p>
                <p>“And what is the diversity in stress? There is major stress &amp; minor, slowly fading &amp; quickly fading. This is called the diversity in stress.</p>
                <p>“And what is the result of stress? There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, grieves, mourns, laments, beats his breast, &amp; becomes bewildered. Or one overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, comes to search outside, ‘Who knows a way or two to stop this pain?’ I tell you, monks, that stress results either in bewilderment or in search. This is called the result of stress.</p>
                <p>“And what is the cessation of stress? From the cessation of craving is the cessation of stress; and just this noble eightfold path—right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration—is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.</p>
                <p>“Now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns stress in this way, the cause by which stress comes into play in this way, the diversity in stress in this way, the result of stress in this way, the cessation of stress in this way, &amp; the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress in this way, then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of stress.</p>
                <p>“‘Stress should be known. The cause by which stress comes into play… The diversity in stress… The result of stress… The cessation of stress… The path of practice for the cessation of stress should be known.’ Thus it has been said, and in reference to this was it said.</p>
                <p>“And this is the penetrative explanation that is a Dhamma explanation.”</p>
